# MATHEMATICAL OBJECTS #

- Real Number -

A real number is an assigned value, with a sign, digits, & decimal places. A real number with no decimal places is an integer.

Examples: -3990, -5, -1.1, 0, 0.5, 1, 14, 41, 237.332, 8343902

- Variable -

A variable is a symbol or letter, used to express an unknown real or integer value.

Examples: n, x, y, z, a, b, c, d

- Expression -

An expression is a string of operations, numbers, or variables, showing an algebraic form.
                                             _
Examples: 2 + 5, 67x, x² + x - 1, 5 * 34, 1/√2

- Equation -

An equation is a statement to show that 2 expressions have the same value.

Examples: 5 + 4 = 9, 2x = 5, 3.4a² - 2a + 0.66 = 0, 4x + 2 = -2x - 7

- Set -

A set is an unordered collection of mathematical objects, with unique values.

Examples: {}, {3, 7, 8}, {x, y, z}, {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}

- Function -

A function takes an input value & returns an output value. Many input values can share an output, but not the other way around.

Common function names are f(x) =, a(n) =, y =, but we can use any variables.

Example: f(x) = 2x + 3

f(0) = 3, f(1) = 5, f(2) = 7, etc.

- Data Set -

A data set is a collection of numbers, like a Set, but with key differences:

* A data set describes only numbers.
* The order of the numbers matter.
* Repeat terms are allowed.
* Data sets have to be finite.

Examples: [4, 5, 6, 1, 4], [14.2, 16.4, 11.9, 15.2, 18.5, 22.1], [1, 2, 3]



# BASIC MATH #

- Plus (+) -

The plus sign is commonly used to represent the addition of 2 numbers or expressions.

Examples: 1 + 1 = 2, -73 + 0.5 = -72.5

It can also be used to express a minimum number.

Examples: 50+ means "greater than or equal to 50"

- Minus (-) -

The minus sign is used to represent lots of things, like:

* Subtraction of 2 numbers or expressions.
* Negative numbers.
* A range of 2 values (no space character).
* The difference between 2 sets.

Examples: 4 - 2 = 2, 49 - 0.1 = 48.9

Examples: -193, -35, -3.24, -0.7

Example: 6-7 is any number between 6 & 7 (inclusive)

Example: {3, 5, 7, 12, 13} - {5, 7, 8, 9} = {3, 12, 13}

- Times (*) -

To represent multiplication, you use the asterisk for 2 numbers.

Examples: 7 * 5 = 35, 2 * -0.01 = -0.02

When dealing with variables or expressions, we put the terms next to each other, or we use parentheses.

Examples: 2x, xy, 3(x + 1), (a + b)(a - b)

- Divide (/) -

The division line --- can be used to represent fractions, or dividing 2 numbers or expressions.

           5                  x
Examples: --- = 1.66666666…, ---
           3                  y

Alternatively, we can use the slash symbol for inline typing.

Example: 6/3.2 = 1.875

- Parentheses (, ) -

Parentheses are normally used for changing the order of operations (BODMAS), but is also used for multiplication. See above.

Example: 41 + 2 * 8 = 57, but (41 + 2) * 8 = 344

- Root (√) -

A root is used to obtain the nonnegative result for xⁿ = y, where y is the target value, & n is the exponent.
The default root is the square root, but it can be changed using a left superscript.
           _                  __
Examples: √5 = 2.23606797…, ³√64 = 4

- Exponents -

An exponent is a right superscript of a number or expression, indicating the number of multiplications required to get the result.

Examples: 0⁰ = 1, (-4.5)² = 20.25, 10⁻⁶ = 0.000001

- Percents (%) -

A percent is a common way to write "out of 100". Has many uses in statistics or increase & decrease.

Example: 23% is 0.23, which means 0.23x out of x, where x is any value.

Example: 6 + 2% = 6 * 1.02 = 6.12

- Ratios -

A ratio is a way of representing a proportion. The right number should usually be 1.

Example: 5.2 : 1 is 5.2x of something out of every x.

- Money -

While money technically doesn't appear in pure math, it appears very often in adult life with its own vast subject.

It is like a real number, except it only has 2 decimal places for cents. Negative numbers represent debt.

Common currencies include: $ (dollar), € (euro), £ (pound), etc.

Examples: -$500, $0.50, $3, $94.99, $1000000



# ALGEBRA #

- Absolute Value -

The absolute value of a number is the distance of a number from 0, where negative numbers become positive.

Example: |5| = 5, |-3| = 3, |0| = 0

- Inequalities -

These 4 symbols (<, >, ≤, ≥) are used in inequalities.

Less than (<) is strictly smaller, while greater than (>) is strictly bigger.

Less than or equal to (≤) is "no more than", while greater than or equal to (≥) is "no less than".

Examples: 5 > 3, 1.41 ≤ x ≤ 1.43, 1/3 < 0.5

- Infinite Decimals -

3 dots (…) is used to represent real numbers with infinite decimal places.

Examples: 3.1415926…, -9999.8888888…, 7.12345679012…

The expansion 0.4444… is normally assumed to be 4/9.

But it can even be 0.44448975849…, or 0.4444333344443333…, or expand to anything.
It is a good idea to give context, so people know exactly what constant you're talking about.

- Coordinates -

In graphing, we have a 2D coordinate system: (x, y) is the point x units to the right, & y units up.

A negative x is left, while a negative y is down. The origin point is (0, 0).

Examples: (3, 5), (5, 3), (103, 11), (-2, -2), (1.2, 4.303)

- Euler's Number (e) -

Euler's number (e) is a constant with a value of 2.718281828459045…

It is related to exponential growth & many areas in math, such as calculus.

- Logarithms -

A logarithm is the solution to aˣ = b, where x is our desired exponent value.

The default logarithm base is Euler's number (2.718281828…) but it can be changed by a right subscript.

Examples: log(2) = 0.6931471805…, log₁₀(1000) = 3, log₇(10) = 1.1832946624…

- Pi (π) -

The constant pi (π) is equal to 3.141592653589793…

It is defined, geometrically, as a circle's circumference divided by its diameter.

It shows up in many areas of math too, by surprise, almost like the "easter egg" of math.

- Degrees -

The degree symbol ° is used in trigonometry.

Real numbers are radians by default, while 1° is π/180, or 0.017453292519…

360° is one full revolution.

- Trigonometry -

Introducing 3 functions: sin(x), cos(x), tan(x)

A sine is the horizontal position (x degrees clockwise about the coordinate (0, 1)) of the unit circle.

Cosine & tangent are defined as: cos(x) = sin(x + 90°), tan(x) = sin(x)/cos(x)

Examples: sin(30°) = 0.5, tan(1) = 1.55740772…

- Inverse Trigonometry -

Arcsine, arccosine, & arctangent return the inverses of sine, cosine & tangent respectively.

The functions asin(x), acos(x), atan(x) return the original value a where -π ≤ a ≤ π, or -180° ≤ a ≤ 180°.

Example: atan(1) = 45°



# NUMBER THEORY #

- Factorial (!) -

The factorial (!) function is defined where n! = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) … 4 * 3 * 2 * 1. Nonnegative integers only.

Examples: 0! = 1, 5! = 120, 9! = 362880

- n choose k -
               n
The function (   ) is the number of ways to choose k items from a set of n total items. Nonnegative integers only.
               k
           5
Example: (   ) = 10
           3

- Greatest Common Factor -

The greatest common factor between 2 numbers gcf(n, k) is the biggest number that both inputs are divisible by. Positive integers only.

Examples: gcf(7, 4) = 1, gcf(36, 75) = 3

- Least Common Multiple -

The least common multiple between 2 numbers lcm(n, k) is the smallest number that is a multiple of the 2 inputs. Positive integers only.

Example: 6 * 8 = 48, but it can be factored out while still being a multiple: lcm(6, 8) = 24



# SET THEORY #

- Union -

The union between 2 sets (A ∪ B), merges all terms into one set, while leaving no duplicates.

Example: {2, 3, 5, 7, 11} ∪ {1, 4, 7, 10} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 11}

- Intersection -

The intersection between 2 sets (A ∩ B), gives the terms that both sets have in common.

Example: {1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36} ∩ {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16} = {4, 16}

- Difference -

The difference between 2 sets removes all terms from the 2nd set from the 1st. See above in the "Basic Math" section.

- Cardinality -

The cardinality of a set n(A), is just the number of terms inside the set. 'Nuff said.

Examples: n({}) = 0, n({33}) = 1, n({a, b, c, d}) = 4

- Natural Numbers -

The symbol ℕ refers to the set of all nonnegative integers. It is an infinite set.

ℕ = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25…}

- Real Numbers -

The symbol ℝ refers to the set of all real numbers. It is an uncountably infinite set, meaning we can not list them all in a "normal" infinite way.



# CALCULUS #

- Sigma Sum -

The sigma symbol Σ is used to write a long, potentially infinite addition expression with finite symbols.

The bottom equation is the starting value, the top number is the value to end at, & the right expression is what we're adding.

         10
         __
Example: \   n² = 9 + 16 + 25 + 36 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 100 = 380
         /_
        n = 3

- Capital Pi Product -

The capital Pi symbol Π is used to write a long, potentially infinite multiplication expression with finite symbols.

It has a similar foundation to the Sigma Sum. Not to be confused with the constant π (3.1415926…).

         10
         __
Example: ||  0.5n = 2.5 * 3 * 3.5 * 4 * 4.5 * 5 = 2362.5
         ||
        n = 5

- Infinity (∞) -

Infinity refers to the idea of a value being greater than any real number. It is not a number, but it's a useful tool for math.

∞ > n

-∞ < n

for all values of n

- Limits -

Sometimes you can't reach a defined value (1/0 is undefined), so we may use limits to approach a desired value.

The number we're heading to narrows in from the lesser & greater side of the value.

                1
Example: lim   --- = -∞ OR ∞
        x -> 0  x

                x² - 1
Example: lim   -------- = 2
        x -> 1  x  - 1

                    1
Example: lim   1 - --- = 1
        x -> ∞      x



# DATA #

- Count -

The "count" of a data set refers to the length of the data set. Similar idea to cardinalities in Sets.

Example: count([1, 5, 3, 5]) = 4

- Total -

The sum of all numbers in a data set is the "total".

Example: total([6, 3, 5, 7, 8, 11]) = 40

- Mean -

The mean of a data set is the average - it is the same as total(n)/count(n).

Use the mean of a data set when distribution is important.

Example: mean([123, 131, 100, 104, 193]) = 130.2

- Median -

To take the median of a data set, sort the list from lowest to highest & find the middle value.

If the count is even, take the mean (average) of the 2 middles.

It is the more accurate idea of finding a central value. Use if distribution doesn't matter.

Examples: median([4, 5, 9, 13, 20]) = 9, median([11.2, 11.46, 12.01, 12.56]) = 11.735



# MODULAR ARITHMETIC #

- Modulus (mod) -

The modulus of a value returns the remainder of a division expression, where numbers wrap around.

Examples: 5 mod 6 = 5, 10 mod 3 = 1, -5 mod 14 = 9

- Congruence -

The congruence symbol looks like an equals sign with 3 lines. It is used to show offsets in number divisibility.

Examples: 9 ≡ 0 mod 3, 44 ≡ 4 mod 10

- Floor -

The floor function rounds a number down to the last integer, towards negative infinity.

Examples: floor(3.2) = 3, floor(-4.1) = -5, floor(10) = 10

- Ceiling -

The ceil function rounds a number up to the next integer, towards positive infinity.

Examples: ceil(3.2) = 4, ceil(-4.1) = -4, ceil(10) = 10

- Round -

The round function rounds a number to the nearest integer, depending on the decimals.
Look at the 1st decimal place & follow the rule:

0,1,2,3,4 --> round down
5,6,7,8,9 --> round up

Examples: round(2.49) = 2, round(2.5) = 3, round(2.51) = 3
