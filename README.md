# combinatorics-calculator

(NEW) An HTML file to calculate all possible ways to do stuff like: Choosing x items from a y-set, Number of ways to order x things with y fixed points, etc.

Note: X & Y values higher than 170 may not work due to floating point limitations. Inputting very high values uses a lot of computation, so your browser may tell you a script is running too long.
