# Useful Tools

### big-number.html

The world's fastest big number calculator made in HTML (probably). This tool can calculate large exponents, factorials, & even Fibonacci numbers at lightning speed. Uses the built-in BigInt library, but with no hard-coded memory limit. It can actually calculate faster than native BigInt!

### partition-generator.html

A simple fast generator for creating all the possible ways of breaking up a positive integer into 2-6 parts. You can also filter for unique numbers only. Uses nested loops to generate partitions.

### unit-converter-bookmarklet.txt

A bookmarklet for quickly converting US imperial units to metric. Convenient for access to "portable conversion". Works on Firefox.

Type in a statement like "50 lb to kg", or "7'6 to cm", or "74 f to c", or "40 mi/h to km/h", etc. Supports 40+ units, even "mgm" for megameters (1000 kilometers).

You must type in abbreviated units (like "km" instead of "kilometers") for the converter to work correctly.

To download, use an online bookmarklet converter & paste the raw document.

### precise-calculator.html

A small high precision calculator available to download for offline use. Uses an offline copy of the big.js library (by @MikeMcl) inside the html file.

Operations supported are: Basic arithmetic (+ - * /), exponents (integer power only), square root, factorial, nCr, cube root. Operations up to 500 decimals.

The calculator has been tested & bugs have been recently fixed.

Type "e" in an input for Euler's Number. Euler's Number is experimental & may have bugs.

### time-converter.html

There are many different ways to show the time, so I made a time converter to display different ways of measuring time (binary coded, noon relative, decimal time, etc.) with a slider.

Note: This tool looks best on a 1080p display.

### 1000.gif / 1000.png

Files made from MS paint & EZGif to generate my Scratch profile picture.

It counts 000-999, & wraps around at 25 numbers per second. 1000.png is the spritesheet, & 1000.gif is the generated GIF file.

### Mod.sprite3

A small mod for Appel to slightly improve gameplay. It can only be used via Turbowarp, because it uses Turbowarp exclusive blocks.

Features:
* Disables music by default
* Use the , . keys to run very fast
* Overrides the Space key to jump very high instead
* Fixes the camera so it locks to the player
* Press the R key to reset the player
* Press the ` (grave accent) key to change the level hue
* Shows a clone counter
